# The Rhino Pad Macro Pad by Kea Workshop

The Rhino Pad is a compact Macro Pad tailored for Computer-Aided Drawing, with 13 keys and an encoder that can be programmed for any macro in your program. It supports QMK or ZMK with either a Pro Micro or similar for QMK, or the Nice!Nano V2 for ZMK. 

The Keycap spacing is 19.05mm x 19.05mm, NOT the usual choc keycap spacing. You can find the 3D printed keycaps on printables https://www.printables.com/model/685983-kea-workshop-choc-v1-mx-spaced-keycaps. 

The Case is 3D printed and uses 3mm x 2mm x 1mm magnets to hold it together. This is included in the files.
